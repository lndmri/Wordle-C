# Wordle-C
This project implements a fun wordle game!

# Usage
- This code is supposed to be ran from the terminal. Having the terminal open on this folder run ".\wordle.exe 5" or recompile it using "gcc -o  wordle wordle.c cs50.c" and then run ".\wordle.exe 5"
- See that the extension of the output file mighy vary depending on your operatig system.

You can run:
- ".\wordle.exe 5" This will choose words of 5 letters
- ".\wordle.exe 6" This will choose words of 6 letters
- ".\wordle.exe 7" This will choose words of 7 letters
- ".\wordle.exe 8" This will choose words of 8 letters

-We run it like this because this program takes command line argument for the number of letter word we want

# Rules
- You have 6 attempts to get the correct answer.
- We give color hints so you know what letters are in the word either in the correct position or not, and the words that are not in the word at all.

* ðŸŸ©#Green background on the letter means the letter is in the word and in the correct position`
* ðŸŸ¨ #Yellow background on the letter means the letter is in the word but in the incorrect position`
* ðŸŸ¥ #Red background on the letter means the letter is not in the word`
